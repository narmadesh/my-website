	<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukt 90 Mantra 1</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>Sahasrsheersha PurushH sahasrakshH sahasrpaat&nbsp;Sa bhumiM vishwatoM vritwatyatishthatdashangulam |1|</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Sahasrsheersha - PurushH - sahasrakshH - sahasrpaat - sa - bhumim -&nbsp;vishwatH - vritwa - atyatishthat - dashangulam ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (PurushH) Viraat-form Kaal God i.e. Kshar Purush&nbsp;(sahasrsheersha) who has thousand hands (sahasrakshH) who has thousand&nbsp;eyes (sahasrpaat ) thousand feet (sa) that Kaal (bhumim ) the twentyone&nbsp;brahmands of the Earth (vishwatH) from all sides (dashangulam ) with&nbsp;the ten fingers i.e. by fully controlling (vritwa) by encircling them (atyatishthat)&nbsp;is also situated above this i.e. lives separately in his Kaal lok in the twentyfirst&nbsp;brahmand.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: The Viraat-form Kaal God i.e. Kshar Purush, who has&nbsp;thousand heads, thousand eyes, thousand feet, that Kaal encircling the&nbsp;twenty-one brahmands of the Earth from all sides with the ten fingers i.e.&nbsp;fully controlling them, is also situated above this i.e. lives separately in his&nbsp;separate lok in the twenty-first brahmand.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - In this Mantra, there is description of Viraat (Kaal/&nbsp;Brahm). [In Gita, Adhyay 10 -11 also, there is a similar description&nbsp;of this Kaal/Brahm. In Adhyay 11 Mantra 46, Arjun is saying that&nbsp;oh Sahasrbaahu i.e one with thousand arms, you may appear in your&nbsp;chaturbhuj form/four-armed form.]</p>
<p>One who has thousand hands, feet, thousand eyes and ears etc.,&nbsp;that Viraat (huge) form Kaal God, keeping all those who are under&nbsp;him in his full control i.e. blocking the 20 brahmands by encircling<br />
them, is himself sitting above them (separately) in the 21st brahmand.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukt 90 Mantra 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>Purush evedM sarvM yad bhootM yachch bhaavyam&nbsp;Utaamrtatvasyeshaano yadannenaatirohti ||2 ||</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Purush - ev - idam - sarvam - yat - bhootam - yat - ch - bhaavyamut&nbsp;- amrtatvasya - ishaanH - yat - annen - atirohti ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (Ev) similarly, he who is somewhat (Purush) God, he is&nbsp;Akshar Purush i.e. ParBrahm (ch) and (idam ) he (yat ) who (bhootam )&nbsp;has taken birth (yat ) who (bhaavyam ) will be born in the future (sarvam )&nbsp;all (yat ) by effort i.e. hardwork (annen) through food grain (atirohti) devel-&nbsp;ops. This Akshar Purush also (ut) doubtful (amrtatvasya) of salvation&nbsp;(ishaanH) is master; which means that, even Akshar Purush is somewhat&nbsp;God, but is not a giver of complete salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: Similarly he, who is somewhat God, is Akshar Purush&nbsp;i.e. ParBrahm. And he who has taken birth or who will be born in the&nbsp;future, all develop through foodgrain by effort i.e. hardwork. This Akshar&nbsp;Purush also is a doubtful master of salvation; which means that, even Akshar&nbsp;Purush is somewhat God, but is not a giver of complete salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - In this Mantra, there is description of ParBrahm&nbsp;(Akshar Purush) who is equipped with some of the qualities of God.&nbsp;But by worshipping him also, one cannot achieve complete salvation&nbsp;(mukti). Therefore, he is called as doubtful giver of salvation.&nbsp;He is said to have some qualities of God because, like Kaal, he&nbsp;does not eat after roasting on tapatshila. But in this ParBrahm's&nbsp;lok also, living beings have to work hard and are paid according to&nbsp;their actions (karmas), and the bodies of the living beings develop<br />
with food grain only. Although, the time period of birth and death is&nbsp;more than that of Kaal's (Kshar Purush's) lok, but reproduction,&nbsp;destruction and the sufferings in the lives of 84 lakh species of life<br />
are inevitable.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukt 90 Mantra 3</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>Etavansya mahimaato jyaayaanshch PurushH&nbsp;Paadoasya vishwa bhootani tripaadasyaamrtM divi ||3 ||</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Etavan - asya - mahima - atH - jyaayaan - ch - PurushH - paadH -&nbsp;asya - vishwa - bhootani - tri - paad - asya - amrtam - divi ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (Asya) this Akshar Purush i.e. ParBrahm has (etavan)&nbsp;only this much (mahima) supremacy (ch) and (PurushH) that Param Akshar&nbsp;Brahm i.e. Purna Brahm / Supreme God (atH) than him (jyaayaan) is greater&nbsp;(vishwa) all (bhootani) Kshar Purush, Akshar Purush and all the living beings&nbsp;in their loks and in Satyalok (asya) of this Supreme God / Param Akshar&nbsp;Purush (paadH) are one foot i.e. are just a small part of Him (asya) this&nbsp;Supreme God's (tri) three (divi) divine loks like, Satyalok - Alakh lok - Agam&nbsp;lok (amrtam ) eternal (paad ) are the other foot i.e. whosoever has originated&nbsp;in all the brahmands is a part or organ of SatyaPurush / Supreme God only.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: This Akshar Purush i.e. ParBrahm has this much supremacy.&nbsp;And that Param Akshar Brahm i.e. Purna Brahm / Supreme God&nbsp;is greater than him. All, Kshar Purush, Akshar Purush and all the living&nbsp;beings in their loks and in Satyalok, are one foot of this Supreme God&nbsp;Param Akshar Purush i.e. are just a small part of Him. This Supreme God's&nbsp;three divine loks like, Satyalok - Alakh lok - Agam lok, are His other&nbsp;eternal foot i.e. whosoever has originated in all the brahmands is a part or&nbsp;organ of SatyaPurush / Supreme God only.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - Akshar Purush (ParBrahm) mentioned in the Mantra&nbsp;2 above has only this much grandeur, and that Supreme God,&nbsp;Kavir Dev is even greater than him i.e is All-Powerful/Almighty,&nbsp;and all the brahmands are positioned only at a part of His.</p>
<p>In this Mantra, there is description of three loks because the&nbsp;fourth Anami (Anamay) lok dates back before all other creation.&nbsp;There is description of these three Gods (Kshar Purush, Akshar&nbsp;Purush and other than these two, Param Akshar Purush) in Shrimad&nbsp;bhagwat Gita Adhyay 15 Shlok 16 - 17.</p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>{<strong>Respected Garib Das Ji</strong> gives the same evidence in his speech: -</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Garib, jaake ardh room par sakal pasaara | aisa Puram Brahm hamaara | |</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Garib anant koti brahmand ka, ek rati nahin bhaar |&nbsp;Satguru Purush Kabir hain, kul ke sirjan haar | |</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>In its evidence, <strong>Respected Dadu Ji</strong> is saying: -</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Jin moku nij naam diya, soi satguru hamaar |&nbsp;Dadu doosra koi nahin, Kabir sirjanhaar ||</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em><strong>Respected Nanak Ji</strong> gives its evidence: -&nbsp;(Shri Guru Granth Sahib; Page no. 721, Mehla 1, Raag Tilang)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Yak arj guftam pesh to dar koon Kartaar ||&nbsp;Hakka Kabir karim Tu beaeb Parvardigaar ||<br />
<br />
The meaning of 'koon Kartaar' is 'the Creator of all' i.e. Shabd&nbsp;Swaroopi&nbsp;God who does creation by the power of word/shabd.&nbsp;'Hakka Kabir' means 'Sat (eternal) Kabir', 'karim' means 'kind',&nbsp;'Parvardigaar' means 'God'}.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukt 90 Mantra 4</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>Tripaadoordhv udaitPurushH paadoasyehaabhavtpunH ||&nbsp;Tato vishv na vykraamatsaashnaanashne abhi | 4|</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Tri - paad - oordhvH - udait - PurushH - paadH - asya -ih - abhavat&nbsp;- punH - tatH - vishvana - vyakraamat - saH - ashnaanashne abhi ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (PurushH) this Param Akshar Brahm i.e. Eternal God&nbsp;(oordhvH) above (tri) three loks like, Satyalok - Alakh lok - Agam lok, -&nbsp;like (paad) one foot i.e. the upper part (udait ) appears i.e. is seated. (asya)&nbsp;this very Supreme God's / Purna Brahm's (paadH) one foot i.e. one part, in&nbsp;the form of the Universe, (punar ) then (ih) here (abhavat ) appears (tatH)&nbsp;therefore (saH) that Eternal Supreme God (ashanaanashne) even eater Kaal&nbsp;i.e. Kshar Purush and non-eater ParBrahm i.e. Akshar Purush (abhi)<br />
above (vishva ) everywhere (vyakraamat ) is pervasive; which means, His&nbsp;supremacy is over all the brahmands and all the gods. He is the Master of&nbsp;the lineage who has extended His power over everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>:This Param Akshar Brahm i.e. Eternal God appears i.e.&nbsp;is seated in the three loks-(Satyalok - Alakh lok - Agam lok)-like foot&nbsp;above i.e. in the upper part. This very Supreme God's / Purna Brahm's&nbsp;one foot i.e. one part, in the form of the Universe, then appears here. Therefore&nbsp;that Eternal/Immortal Supreme God is pervasive everywhere even&nbsp;above the eater Kaal i.e. Kshar Purush and the non-eater ParBrahm i.e.&nbsp;Akshar Purush; which means, His supremacy is over all the brahmands and&nbsp;all the gods. He is the Master of the lineage who has extended His power&nbsp;over everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - This God, the Creator of the entire Nature, Himself&nbsp;appears in three different forms i.e. is Himself present in the three&nbsp;places (Satlok, Alakh lok, Agam lok) in the upper part of His creation.&nbsp;Here, Anami lok has not been mentioned because there is no&nbsp;creation there, and the Akah (Anamay/Anami) lok existed before&nbsp;the rest of the creation. Then, it is said that, after separation from&nbsp;that God's Satlok, the lower Brahm and ParBrahm's loks arise, and&nbsp;that Supreme God is also present everywhere above the eater Brahm&nbsp;i.e. Kaal (because Brahm-Kaal / Viraat eats one-lakh human beings&nbsp;daily because of the curse on him) and the non-eater ParBrahm i.e.&nbsp;Akshar Purush (ParBrahm does not eat human beings, but birth death&nbsp;and punishment according to their actions, remain the same&nbsp;in his loks); which means, this Supreme God's supremacy is over&nbsp;everyone. Supreme God Kabir only is the Master of the lineage who&nbsp;has extended His power over everyone. Like, the sun affects everyone&nbsp;by spreading its light. Similarly, the Supreme God has extended&nbsp;the range (capacity) of His power over all the brahmands&nbsp;to control&nbsp;them. Like, the tower of a mobile phone even when present in one&nbsp;area, extends its power i.e. the range (capacity) of the mobile in all&nbsp;the four directions. Likewise, Supreme God / Purna Prabhu has extended&nbsp;His invisible power everywhere, by which Supreme God controls&nbsp;all the brahmands sitting at one place.Respected Garib Das Ji is&nbsp;giving its evidence: - (Amritvaani Raag Kalyan)</p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Teen charan Chintamani saheb, shesh badan par chhaaye ||&nbsp;Maata, pita, kul n bandhu, na kinhe janani jaaye |</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukta 90 Mantra 5</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>Tasmaadviraatajaayat viraajo adhi PurushH |&nbsp;Sa jaato atyarichyat pashchaad abhoomimatho purH || 5||</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Tasmaat - viraat - ajaayat - viraajH - adhi - PurushH - sa - jaatH -&nbsp;atyarichyat - pashchaat - bhoomim - athH - purH ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (Tasmaat ) thereafter, from the word-power/shabd-shakti&nbsp;of that Supreme God SatyaPurush (viraat ) Viraat i.e. Brahm who is also&nbsp;known as Kshar Purush and Kaal (ajaayat) originated (pashchaat ) after&nbsp;this (viraajH) than Viraat Purush i.e. Kaal God (adhi) greater (PurushH)&nbsp;Supreme God (bhoomim ) the loks of the Earth, loks of Kaal-Brahm and&nbsp;ParBrahm (atyarichyat) properly created (athH) then (purH) other small small&nbsp;loks (sa) that Supreme God only (jaatH) created i.e. established&nbsp;Translation: Thereafter, Viraat i.e. Brahm, who is also known as Kshar&nbsp;Purush and Kaal, originated from the word-power/shabd-shakti of that&nbsp;Supreme God . After this, the Supreme God , who is greater than Viraat&nbsp;Purush i.e. Kaal God, properly created the loks of the Earth; loks of Kaal Brahm&nbsp;and ParBrahm. Then that Supreme God only created other small small&nbsp;loks i.e. established them.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - After the creation of the three loks (Agam lok, Alakh&nbsp;lok, and Satlok) mentioned in the aforesaid Mantra 4, the Supreme&nbsp;God gave rise to Jyoti Niranjan (Brahm) i.e. from that All-powerful&nbsp;God Purna Brahm, KavirDev (God Kabir) only, Viraat i.e. Brahm&nbsp;(Kaal) was born. This same evidence is in Gita Adhyay 3 Mantra 15&nbsp;that Brahm originated from the Akshar God i.e. Eternal God. This&nbsp;very evidence is also in Atharvaved Kaand 4 Anuvaak 1 Sukt 3 that&nbsp;Brahm originated from Purna Brahm&nbsp;and that same Purna Brahm&nbsp;created (bhoomim ) all the small and big loks. That Purna Brahm is&nbsp;greater than this Viraat God i.e. Brahm; which means, is also his&nbsp;(Brahm's) Master.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukta 90 Mantra 15</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>SaptaasyaasanparidhayastriH sapt samidhH krtaH |&nbsp;Deva yadhyagyaM tanvaana abadhnanPurushM pashum || 15 ||</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Sapt - asya - aasan - paridhayH - trisapt - samidhH - krtaH - deva -&nbsp;yat - yagyam - tanvaanaH - abadhnan - Purusham - pashum ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (Sapt) seven sankh brahmands of ParBrahm and (trisapt)&nbsp;the twenty-one brahmands of Kaal/Brahm (samidhH) tortured by the fire&nbsp;of the sufferings of the punishment of sinful deeds (krtaH) which does&nbsp;(paridhayH) in the circular boundary (aasan) is present (yat ) who&nbsp;(Purusham) of the Supreme God (yagyam ) offers religious service according&nbsp;to the ordinances i.e. worships (pashum ) bound in the trap of Kaal to&nbsp;the bondage of actions like a sacrificial animal (deva) devout souls&nbsp;(tanvaanaH) from the web of the bondage of sinful actions created i.e.&nbsp;spread by Kaal (abadhnan ) liberates i.e. is the liberator of the bondage; is&nbsp;Bandichhor.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>:The seven sankh brahmands of ParBrahm and the twentyone&nbsp;brahmands of Kaal/Brahm are present in the circular boundary, which&nbsp;tortures one in the fire of the sufferings of the punishment of sinful deeds.&nbsp;He who offers religious service to i.e. worships the Supreme God according&nbsp;to the ordinances, Supreme God liberates those devout souls bound&nbsp;like a sacrificial animal to the bondage of actions in the trap of Kaal from&nbsp;the trap of the bondage of actions created i.e. spread by Kaal; which means&nbsp;He is the liberator from the bondage i.e is Bandichhor.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - The Supreme God tells the true way of worship to&nbsp;the living beings, who are bound in the circular boundary of the seven&nbsp;sankh brahmands of ParBrahm and twenty-one brahmands of Brahm<br />
and who are burning in the fire of their sinful actions, and makes&nbsp;them do the correct way of worship. On the basis of which, He liberates&nbsp;His devotee souls, who like a sacrificial animal, suffer from the&nbsp;agony of tapatshila (A piece of rock in the shape of a griddle which automatically remains hot, on&nbsp;which Kaal&nbsp;roasts the immaterial bodies of one lakh human beings)&nbsp;and births-deaths (for Kaal's food), by breaking&nbsp;the trap of the bondage of actions, and therefore, is the liberator&nbsp;i.e. Bandichhor.</p>
<p>Its evidence also lies in Holy Yajurved Adhyay 5, Mantra 32,&nbsp;that Kaviranghaariasi: (Kavir ) Supreme God Kabir (Asi) is (Ari)&nbsp;the enemy of (Angh) sins, which means that God Kabir is the destroyer&nbsp;of all sins. Bambhaariasi: (Bambhaari) the enemy of bondage&nbsp;i.e. the liberator, Bandichhor (Asi) is Supreme God Kabir.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Rigved Mandal 10 Sukta 90 Mantra 16</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;"><em>Yagyen yagyamayajant devaastaani dharmaani prthmaanyaasan |&nbsp;Te ha naakaM mahimaanH sachant yatr poorve saadhyaH santi devaH | 16||</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Yagyen - yagyam - a - yajant - devaH - taani - dharmaani - prthmaani&nbsp;-aasan - te - ha - naakam - mahimaanH- sachant - yatr - poorve - saadhyaH&nbsp;- santi - devaH ||</span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>:Who (devaH) flawless god-like devout souls (ayagyam)&nbsp;in place of the incomplete wrong religious worship (yagyen) on the basis of&nbsp;the religious act of true bhakti59 (yajant) worship (taani) they (dharmaani)&nbsp;enriched with the religious power (prthmaani) are main i.e. superior (aasan)&nbsp;are (te ha) they only in reality (mahimaanH) equipped with the great power&nbsp;of bhakti (saadhyaH) successful devout souls (naakam ) the complete happiness-giving&nbsp;Supreme God (sachant) on the basis of bhakti i.e. the earnings<br />
of true bhakti, attain. They go there (yatr) where (poorve) of the&nbsp;earlier creation (devaH) sinless god-like devout souls (santi) live.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: Those flawless god-like devout souls, who in place of&nbsp;the incomplete wrong way of worship, worship on the basis of the religious&nbsp;act of true bhakti, they, enriched with the religious power, are main i.e.&nbsp;superior. They i.e. the successful devotees, in reality, by being equipped&nbsp;with the great power of bhakti, attain the complete happiness-giving Supreme&nbsp;God on the basis of the bhakti i.e. the earnings of the true bhakti.&nbsp;They go there where the sinless god-like devout souls of the earlier creation<br />
live.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: - Those flawless (who have given up consumption of&nbsp;meat, alcohol, tobacco and are free from other vices) god-like devout&nbsp;souls who abandoning the way of worship against the injunctions&nbsp;of the scriptures, do scripture-based worship, they becoming&nbsp;rich with the earnings of bhakti and free from the debt of Kaal, because of the earnings of their true bhakti, attain that all-happiness&nbsp;giving God i.e. they go to Satlok where the sinless god-like hans&nbsp;souls of the first creation live.</p>
<p>Like, some souls came here after being caught in Kaal's&nbsp;(Brahm's) trap; some came with ParBrahm in seven sankh&nbsp;brahmands. But even then infinite souls, whose faith in the Supreme&nbsp;God remained unchanged and who did not fail in their loyalty towards&nbsp;their Master, remained there in Satlok. Therefore, here even&nbsp;the Vedas have proved this description to be true. This evidence is&nbsp;also given in Gita Adhyay 8 Shlok 8 to 10 that a devotee who does&nbsp;true sadhna of Supreme God according to the injunctions of the scriptures,&nbsp;he by the power of the earnings of bhakti attains that Supreme&nbsp;God i.e. goes to Him. This proves that there are three Gods&nbsp;Brahm, ParBrahm and Purna Brahm. These are also known by synonyms&nbsp;like (1) Brahm - Ish - Kshar Purush, (2) ParBrahm - Ishwar -&nbsp;Akshar Purush - Akshar Brahm (3) Purna Brahm - Param Akshar&nbsp;Brahm - Parmeshwar - SatPurush - and Param Akshar Purush.</p>
<p>It is also evident in RigVed Mandal 9 Sukta 96 Mantra 17 to 20,&nbsp;that the Supreme God KavirDev (Kabir Parmeshwar) appears by acquiring&nbsp;the form of a child and delivers His pure knowledge i.e.&nbsp;Tatvgyan to His followers through (KavirgirbhiH) Kabir Vaani by telling&nbsp;aloud. That KavirDev (Supreme God Kabir) is seated in human form&nbsp;in the third Ritdhaam (Satlok) of Purna Brahm61 (Param Akshar&nbsp;Purush), which is different from Brahm's (Kshar Purush's) abode/&nbsp;Dhaam and ParBrahm's (Akshar Purush's) abode. The fourth lok from&nbsp;Satlok is Anami lok, in that also this same KavirDev (Supreme God&nbsp;Kabir) is seated in visible human-like form as Anami Purush.</p>
