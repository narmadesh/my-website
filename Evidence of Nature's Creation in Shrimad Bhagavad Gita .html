	<h3><span style="color:#B22222;">Kaal (Brahm) has given information about Creation of Nature in Holy Bhagavad Gita, Adhyay 14 Shlok 3 to 5.</span>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;">Brahm (Kaal) is saying that Prakriti (Durga) is my wife and I, Brahm&nbsp;(Kaal), am her husband. The three gunas (qualities) [Rajgun-Brahma, Satgun-Vishnu, and Tamgun-Shiv] along with all the living&nbsp;beings have originated from the union of us two. I (Brahm) am the&nbsp;father of all the living beings and Prakriti (Durga) is their mother. I&nbsp;place the seed in her womb from which all beings are produced. The&nbsp;three gunas (Rajgun Brahma, Satgun Vishnu and Tamgun Shiv) originated&nbsp;from Prakriti bind the living being to a body based on its deeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>Gita Adhyay 14 Shlok 3</strong></span></p>

(mm) my (mahat) Primeval Prakriti i.e. Durga, of all the living beings (yoniH) is the womb, and (aham&nbsp;Brahm) I, Brahm-Kaal (tasmin) in that womb (garbham) seed (dadhaami) place/impregnate (tatH) by that union (sarvbhootaanaam) all the living beings (sambhavH) birth (bhavti) takes place.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Oh Arjun! My Primeval Prakriti i.e. Durga is the womb of all the living beings and I, Brahm-Kaal, place the seed in that womb. By that union all the living beings are born.</p>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> (Kauntey) Oh Arjun! (sarvyonishu) in all the wombs (yaaH) whatever (moortayH) embodied beings (sambhavanti) are born (mahat) the Primeval Prakriti (taasaam) of all those (yoniH) is the mother who conceives them and (aham&nbsp;Brahm) I, Brahm-Kaal (beejprdH) the seed-giving (pita) am father.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Oh Arjun! Whatever embodied beings are born in all the wombs, the Primeval Prakriti is their mother who conceives them and I, Brahm-Kaal, am the seed-giving father.</p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>Gita Adhyay 14 Shlok 5</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> (Mahabaho) Oh Arjun! (satvam) Satvagun (rajH) Rajogun (tamH) Tamogun (iti) these (prkritisambhvaaH) born of Prakriti (gunaH) three gunas (avyyam) eternal (dehinm) soul (dehe) to body (nibadhanti) bind.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Oh Arjun! Satvagun, Rajogun and Tamogun, these three gunas born of Prakriti bind the eternal soul to body.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (UttamH) Supreme (PurushH) God (tu) however&nbsp;(anyaH) is someone else other than the two aforesaid Gods "Kshar Purush&nbsp;and Akshar Purush" (iti) in reality this (Parmatma) God (udahrtH) is called&nbsp;(yaH) who (loktryam ) into the three loks (aavishya) entering (bibharti)&nbsp;maintains / sustains everyone and (avyyaH) eternal (iishwarH) is God (Ishwar&nbsp;means greatest) among the gods i.e. is the Almighty God).</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>:The Supreme God is, however, someone else other than&nbsp;the two aforesaid Gods "Kshar Purush and Akshar Purush". In reality, He&nbsp;is called God/Parmatma, who by entering into the three loks, nurtures and&nbsp;protects everyone, and is Eternal God (Ishwar means the greatest among&nbsp;the gods i.e. is the Almighty God).</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: God, the giver of the knowledge of Gita, has only&nbsp;told this much that consider this world to be an upside-down tree.&nbsp;The root above (base) is Purna Parmatma. Know the branches etc.&nbsp;below as the other parts. A saint, who distinctly knows the description&nbsp;of every part of this world-like tree, is a Tatvdarshi Saint about&nbsp;whom there is a mention in Gita Adhyay 4 Shlok no. 34. In Gita&nbsp;Adhyay 15 Shlok 2, 3, only this much has been told that the three&nbsp;gunas are in the form of branches. Here in this discussion i.e. in&nbsp;Gita, I (the giver of the knowledge of Gita) cannot give you the full&nbsp;information because I do not have knowledge about the beginning&nbsp;and the end of the creation of this world. For that it is said in Gita&nbsp;Adhyay 4 Shlok no. 34 that, gain knowledge about that Purna&nbsp;Parmatma from a Tatvdarshi Saint. In this Gita Adhyay 15 Shlok 1,&nbsp;the identity of that Tatvdarshi Saint has been mentioned that he will&nbsp;give knowledge about every part of the world-like tree. Ask him&nbsp;only. In Gita Adhyay 15 Shlok 4, it is said that after finding that&nbsp;Tatvdarshi Saint, one should search for that Param Pad Parmeshwar&nbsp;(the Supreme God with Supreme State) i.e. one should do sadhna&nbsp;according to the directions of that Tatvdarshi Saint, by which one&nbsp;attains complete salvation (eternal salvation). It has been clarified&nbsp;in Gita Adhyay 15 Shlok 16, 17 that, there are three Gods; one is&nbsp;Kshar Purush (Brahm), second is Akshar Purush (ParBrahm), and&nbsp;third is Param Akshar Purush (Purna Brahm). Kshar Purush and&nbsp;Akshar Purush are actually not eternal/immortal. That Eternal/Immortal&nbsp;God is someone else other than these two. He only by entering&nbsp;into the three worlds/loks, sustains and nurtures everyone.&nbsp;It has been proved in the above-mentioned Shrimad bhagavad&nbsp;Gita Adhyay 15, Shlok 1 - 4 and 16, 17 that the root of this upsidedown&nbsp;worldly tree is Param Akshar Brahm i.e. Purna Brahm from&nbsp;whom the whole tree gets nourishment. The part of the tree seen&nbsp;just above the ground is called 'trunk' and consider this to be 'Akshar&nbsp;Brahm' i.e. ParBrahm. From that trunk, several bigger branches&nbsp;arise. Consider, one of the bigger branches to be Brahm i.e. Kshar&nbsp;Purush. And from that bigger branch, arise other three smaller&nbsp;branches; consider them to be Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv. Beyond&nbsp;the branches, are the leaves and consider them to be the living beings&nbsp;of this world.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned Gita Adhyay 15, Shlok 16 and 17, it is&nbsp;clear that Kshar Purush (Brahm) and Akshar Purush (ParBrahm)&nbsp;and the material bodies of all the living beings in their loks are perishable&nbsp;and their souls are imperishable; which means that the aforesaid&nbsp;Gods and the living beings under them are perishable. Even&nbsp;though, Akshar Purush (ParBrahm) has been called as imperishable,&nbsp;but, in reality, the Eternal God is someone else other than&nbsp;these two. He, on entering into the three worlds, nurtures and sustains&nbsp;everyone. In the above description, a distinct description of&nbsp;three Gods has been given.&nbsp;</p>
