	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Identification of a Complete Saint from Holy Scriptures</h3>
<p>There is evidence in Vedas, Gita Ji etc Holy Scriptures that whenever there is decline of virtues and an uprise of sins and the form of the path of bhakti is distorted by the contemporary saints, mahants, and gurus, at that time, God either by coming Himself or by sending His most knowledgeable saint again establishes the virtues by means of the true knowledge. He explains the path of bhakti according to the scriptures.</p>
<h1><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>His identification lies in the fact that the contemporary religious gurus stand in his opposition, and by misleading the king and the people, inflict atrocities on Him.</strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>Kabir Sahib Ji says in His speech</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>जो मम संत सत उपदेश दृढ़ावै (बतावै), वाके संग सभि राड़ बढ़ावै।<br>
या सब संत महंतन की करणी, धर्मदास मैं तो से वर्णी।।</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>Jo mm sant sat updesh drdaavae (bataavae), vaake sang sabhi raad badaavae&nbsp;<br>
Ya sab sant mahantan ki karni, Dharmdas main to se varni</em></span></p>
<p>God Kabir Ji is explaining to His dear disciple Dharmdas in His speech that the saint of mine who will tell the path of true bhakti, all the saints and mahants will quarrel with him. This will be the identity of that Complete&nbsp;Saint.</p>
<h1><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Second identity: A True saint is a complete knower of all the religious texts. </strong></span></h1>
<p><strong>Satguru Garibdas Ji’s says in his speech</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kabir Sahib says</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>कबीर, गुरू बिन माला फेरते गुरू बिन देते दान।&nbsp;गुरू बिन दोनों निष्फल है पूछो वेद पुराण।।</em></span></p>

<h1><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The third identity is that he will give updesh of three types of mantras (naams) in&nbsp;three stages.</strong>&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>Its description is available in <strong>Kabir Sagar Granth, page no. 265 Bodh Sagar</strong> and in <strong>Gita Ji Adhyay no. 17 Shlok 23</strong>, and in <strong>Samved Sankhya no. 822</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Kabir Sagar, Amar Mool Bodh Sagar, page no 265</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>तब कबीर अस कहेवे लीन्हा, ज्ञानभेद सकल कह दीन्हा।।<br>

Ja ko hoy divya gyan parvesha, tako kahe tatv gyan updesha</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>It is clear from the aforesaid speech that a Complete Saint&nbsp;provides mantras upto Saarnaam in three stages and in the fourth stage provides Saarshabd. </strong></span></p>
<p>Our Gurudev Rampal Ji Maharaj in <strong>the first stage</strong>&nbsp;give jaap of naam of Shri Ganesh ji, Shri Brahma-Savitri ji, Shri Lakshmi-Vishnu ji, Shri Shankar-Parvati ji and Mother Sheranwali, who reside in the chakras built in our human body.</p>
<p>Shri Ganesh ji resides in 'Mooladhar' chakra, Brahma-Savitri ji resides in 'Swaad' chakra, Lakshmi-Vishnu ji resides in 'Naabhi' chakra, Shankar-Parvati ji in 'Hridya' chakra, and Mother Sheranwali resides in 'Kanth' chakra, and all these gods goddesses have Aadi Anaadi naam (eternal/Original name) mantras, of which the contemporary gurus are not aware of. By the jaap of these mantras all these five chakras open up. A human being becomes suitable for doing bhakti after these chakras open up.</p>
<p>Satguru Garibdas Ji gives evidence in his speech</p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>पांच नाम गुझ गायत्री आत्म तत्व जगाओ।<br>
ॐ किलियं हरियम् श्रीयम् सोहं ध्याओ।।</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>Paanch naam gujh gayatri aatm tatv jagaao<br>
ॐ kiliyaM hariyam shriyam sohM dhyaao</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>:&nbsp;Awaken your soul by doing jaap of these five naams which are ‘Gujh Gayatri’.</p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Some innocent devotees say that our Guruji arouse Kundalni power. It is a request to them that Kundalni Power can not be aroused without Gayatri mantra; they are only misleading you.</em></span></p>
<p>In <strong>the second stage</strong>&nbsp;Sant Rampal Ji&nbsp;gives jaap of two words, among which one is ‘Om’ and the second is Tat’ (which is a secret and is only told to an updeshi / follower), which are chanted through breaths.</p>
<p>In <strong>the third stage</strong> Sant Rampal Ji, gives Saarnaam which is a complete secret.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Evidence of Naam Jaap in Three Stages</h3>
<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Gita Adhyay 17 Shlok 23</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>ॐ, Tat, Sat, iti nirdeshH, BrhmnH, trividhH, smritH, BrahmnaH, ten, vedaH, ch, yagyaH, ch, vihitaH, pura</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (ॐ) ॐ/Om is mantra of Brahm (Tat ) Tat - this is indicative mantra of ParBrahm (Sat ) Sat - this is indicative mantra of Purna Brahm (iti) in this way, this (trividhH) of three types (BrhmnH) of sumiran2 of naam of Supreme God (nirdeshH) an direction (smritH) is said to be (ch) and (pura) in the beginning of nature (brahmnaH) the scholars&nbsp;told that (ten) that same Supreme God (vedaH) Ved (ch) and (yagyaH) yagya etc (vihitaH) created.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: ॐ /Om is mantra of Brahm, Tat - this is indicative mantra of ParBrahm, Sat - this is indicative mantra of Purna Brahm, in this way, this is said to be direction of sumiran of three types of naams for attaining Supreme God, and in the beginning of nature, Brahmins i.e. learned men used to do sadhna based on this only and they told that, that same Supreme God created Ved and yagya etc.</p>
<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Mantra no. 822 Samved Utarchik Adhyay 3 Khand no. 5 Shlok no. 8</strong></span> (Translated by Sant Rampal Das)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>ManeeshibhiH – pavte – poorvyaH – Kavir′ - nrbhiH – yatH – pari – koshaan′ - asishyadat′ - tri – tasya – naam – janayan′ - madhu – ksharanH – na – indrasya – vaayum′ - sakhyay – vardhyan′</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: (PoorvyaH) Primordial i.e. Eternal (Kavir nrbhiH) Supreme God Kabir, by acquiring a human form i.e. appearing as a Guru (maneeshibhiH) to a devout soul who does bhakti with devotion and loves Him from heart (tri) three (naam) giving mantra i.e. naam updesh (pavte) by purifying (janayan ) birth and (ksharanH) from death (na) makes free from and (tasya) his/her (vaayum ) the countable life-breaths which are put according to destiny (koshaan ) from His store (sakhyay) on the basis of friendship (pari) completely (vardhayan') increases (yatH) as a result of which (indrasya) of Supreme God (madhu) the real happiness (asishyadat ) makes him attain by His blessings.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: The Primordial i.e. Eternal Supreme God Kabir assuming a human form i.e. appearing as a Guru, giving three mantras i.e. naam updesh to a devout soul who does bhakti with devotion and loves Him from heart, by purifying him, releases him from birth and death, and completely increases his/her countable life-breaths, which have been put according to the destiny, from His store on the basis of friendship. As a result of which, makes him/ her attain the real happiness of Supreme God by His blessings.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: <span style="color:#008080;"><strong>It has been clarified in this Mantra that Supreme God Kavir i.e. Kabir manifesting in the form of a Guru in human&nbsp;body, by giving jaap of three naams to God-loving soul, makes him/ her do true bhakti, and by purifying that devotee friend, by His blessings, makes him achieve complete happiness by attaining the Supreme God. He increases the age of the worshipper. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Shrimad Bhagavad Gita</em></span><span style="color:#696969;"><em>&nbsp;talks about obtaining this naam from a Tatvdarshi (having complete knowledge) saint&nbsp;in </em></span><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Gita Adhyay 4 Shlok 34</em></span><span style="color:#696969;"><em>.&nbsp;And in </em></span><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Gita Adhyay 15 Shlok 1 to 4, the identity of a Tatvdarshi (True) saint has been given</em></span><span style="color:#696969;"><em>, and it has been&nbsp;said that after knowing the Tatvgyan (true knowledge) from the Tatvdarshi Saint, one should search for that Param Pad (supreme state) of Supreme God. Having gone where, devotees do not return to the world i.e. they become completely liberated. That same Supreme God has created the world.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: It has become clear from the above-mentioned description that even the four Holy Vedas are testifying that the Supreme God alone is worthy of being worshipped. His real name is KavirDev (Kabir God) and complete salvation is attained only by the jaap of the three mantras.</p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>God Kabir had forbidden Dharmdas Ji to give Saarshabd and had said that if any messenger of Kaal gets hold of Saarshabd, then the hans of the intermediate generation will not get liberated. Like, in the beginning of Kalyug, the devotees of the first generation were illiterate and at the end of Kalyug the devotees of the last generation will become ungrateful and in the present time, the intermediate generation has started after the independence of India in year 1947 A.D. Now all the devotees are literate. Scriptures are available with us. Now this true path, true sadhna will spread in the whole world and the fake gurus, saints and mahants will keep hiding.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Holy Book Kabir Sagar, Adhyay Jeev Dharm Bodh, Shaakha Bodh Sagar on page 1937</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>धर्मदास तोहि लाख दुहाई, सार शब्द कहीं बाहर नहीं जाई।<br>
सार शब्द बाहर जो परि है, बिचली पीढ़ी हंस नहीं तरि है।</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Dharmdas tohi laakh dohaai, saar shabd kahin baahar nahin jaai<br>
Saar shabd baahar jo pari hai, bichli peedi hans nahin tari hai</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>Evidence in Guru Nanak Dev ji's speech</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>Chahaoon ka sang, chahaoon ka meet, jaamae chaari hataavae nit |&nbsp;Man pavan ko raakhae band, lahe trikuti trivaeni sandh ||&nbsp;Akhand mandal mein sunn samaana, man pavan sachch khand tikaana ||&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>Only he is a Complete Satguru who gives naam in three stages and tells the method of sumiran (rememberance of naam) with breath. Only then the salvation of a living being is possible. Just as God is true, similarly, the interview with God and also the method of attaining salvation is also eternal and true, which never changes.</p>
