	<h3>Evidence of God Kabir in Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji - Rag Siri Mehla 1</h3>
<p>Shri Nanak Dev Ji previously used to do jaap of one Onkaar (Om') mantra and only considering it to be true used to say ‘Ek Onkaar’. Kabir Sahib appeared before Shri Nanak Dev Ji on the bank of river Bein and took him to Satlok (Sachkhand) and showed him His SatPurush form and then on the third day left him back on the Earth. After that Shri Nanak Ji eulogised the eye-witnessed glory of God Kabir, which is present in his sacred speech in Shri Guru Granth Sahib in Mehla Pehla. Only after God Kabir gave Shri Nanak Ji jaap of Satnaam, Shri Nanak Ji got liberated from Kaal’s lok.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> It has been clearly written in this that one dog (in the form of mind) and along with these two bitches (in the form of expectations and desires) are always unnecessarily barking (i.e. desires keep on arising) and new-new expectations keep arising all the time. The method (without Satnaam) of killing them was a false (kud) means (muth murdaar). God (Kabir Sahib) met me in the form of a weaver (dhaanak). He told me the correct way of worship.</p>
<p>Shri Nanak Sahib Ji says that without the sadhna of that God (Dhaanak / weaver Kabir Sahib) neither there would have been any reputation (pati) nor there was any good deed (good earning) being done. Consequently, the terrible form of Kaal which I have perceived now, Kabir Sahib, from that only your one (Satnaam) naam can convey the whole world across (can extricate from Kaal’s lok). Even I (Nanak Ji says) am only hopeful of your this naam, and only this naam is my base. Earlier I must have also criticised you a lot out of ignorance because lust and anger, these devils live in this body.</p>
<p>The God in the form of a (dhaanak) weaver (Kabir Sahib who used to work as a weaver) came and showed me the true path and released me from Kaal. His (surat) appearance is very pleasing and charming and is in beautiful attire (in form of Jinda). He met me; nobody can recognise Him, who even befooled Kaal i.e. He appears to be a dhaanak (weaver) and then became Jinda. Even Kaal God became confused that this is someone of a low caste; he can not be God (Purna Brahm). In this way, Kabir Sahib hiding his real form comes as a servant. Kaal or an ordinary person cannot recognise Him. Therefore, Shri Nanak Sahib Ji has called him a thug (imposter) and along with this has said that Dhaanak (weaver Kabir Sahib) is very intelligent. Appears to be something else, but is very magnificent (bahuta bhaar), the God Purna Brahm who has Himself come in the form of a weaver, a dhaanak. To instruct every human being on submissiveness, accepting his mistake says that I (Nanak Ji) argued with Purna Brahm and He (Kabir Sahib) also presented Himself (acting) as a servant and addressed me (Nanak Ji) as Master. Therefore highlighting His greatness and repenting on his ignorance Shri Nanak Ji says that I (Nanak Ji) was not even worthy of doing and getting anything done. Even then considering my sadhna to be superior, confronted (debated on knowledge) God. Who can be as low, wicked and good-for-nothing like me, who could not recognise his Lord-Master Purna Parmatma in a dhaanak form (Supreme God Kabir Sahib who came as a weaver)? <strong>Shri Nanak Sahib Ji states that I am saying all this with full consideration that the Supreme God is in the form of a dhaanak (Weaver Kabir).</strong></p>
