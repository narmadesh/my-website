	<p><span style="color:#696969;"><em>(Translator Shri Munilal Gupt, Publisher - Govind Bhawan Karyalay, Gita Press Gorakhpur)</em></span></p>
<p>Vishnu Puran's knowledge has been said by Shri Parasar Rishi Ji to Shri Maitrey Rishi Ji.</p>
<h3>Tale of Rishi Parasar and birth of Rishi Ved Vyas</h3>
<p>Shri Parasar Rishi Ji soon after getting married took a firm decision of abandoning home and doing sadhna in the forest. His wife said, "Just now we have got married, and you are leaving home. Go for sadhna after having children." Then Shri Parasar Rishi said that having children after doing sadhna will produce an offspring with noble instincts. After some time I will send my power (semen) for you through some bird; you may accept it. On saying this, abandoned home and departed to the forest. After one year of sadhna, taking out his semen and encasing in a leaf of a tree, protecting the semen by the power of his mantra said to a crow that go and give this leaf to my wife. Carrying it the crow was flying over a river. That leaf fell in the river from his beak. A fish ate it. A few months later, a boatman caught that fish and cut it. A girl came out of it. The&nbsp;boatman named the girl as Satyavati. The same girl (because of being born from the stomach of a fish) was also known as Machhodri. The boatman brought Satyavati up as his daughter.</p>
<p>The crow, on returning, narrated the whole account to Shri Parasar Ji that another crow tried to snatch that semen filled leaf from me considering it to be a piece of flesh, because of which it fell in the river and immediately a fish ate it. When after finishing sadhna Shri Parasar Ji was returning after sixteen years, he called the boatman for crossing the river, and said, "Quickly take me across the river. My wife is waiting for me." At that time the boatman was having food and the fourteen-year-old young girl born from Shri Parasar Rishi's seed from a fish was present there holding food for her father. The boatman knew that a Rishi who comes after doing sadhna-meditation (tapasya) is equipped with siddhi (supernatural powers). If his orders are not obeyed quickly, he gives curse. The boatman said, "Rishivar, I am eating food; to leave unfinished food is disrespect to the Ann Dev (Food God). I will incur sin." But Shri Parasar Ji did not pay a slightest attention to what he said. Seeing Rishi very eager, the boatman told his young daughter to take Rishi Ji across. On getting father's order, his daughter took Rishi Parasar Ji in the boat and set off. On reaching the middle of the river, Rishi Parasar Ji expressed a desire to perform an evil act with that girl born from his own seed-power from a fish i.e. with his own daughter. The girl also used to hear the tales of people afflicted by the curse given by angry Rishis (sages), from her foster boatman father. Trembing with the fear of curse, the girl said, "Rishi Ji, you are Brahmin. I am a daughter of a Shudra." Rishi Parasar Ji said, "No problem." To save her honour, the girl again made an excuse, "Oh Rishivar, my body smells of fish." Rishi Parasar Ji finished the smell by his supernatural power. Then the girl said, "People are watching on both the ends." Rishi Parasar Ji taking water of river Ganga in his hand threw it in the sky and created fog by his supernatural power. He fulfilled his desire. The girl apprised her foster father of the whole incident through her foster mother and told that Rishi told his name to be Parasar, and himself to be the grandson of Rishi Vashishth Ji. When the time arrived, Shri Vyas Rishi Ji was born&nbsp;from the womb of the unmarried girl.</p>
<h3>Description by Rishi Parasar in Vishnu Puran is Hear-Say knowledge</h3>
<p>Shri Vishnu Puran has been composed by that same Shri Parasar Ji. Shri Parasar Ji told that oh Maitrey, the knowledge that I am going to narrate to you, Daksh-etc Munis (seers) had narrated this very topic to King Purukuts on the bank of river Narmada. Purukuts to Sarasvat and Sarasvat had said to me. Shri Parasar Ji has said in Shri Vishnu Puran, First Adhyay Shlok no. 31, page no 3 that this universe has originated from Vishnu; it is situated in him only. He only is the composer of its state and rhythm. In Adhyay 2 Shlok 15, 16, on Page 4, it is said that oh Dwij! The first form of ParBrahm appears to be like Purush i.e. God, but 'manifested' (to appear in MahaVishnu form) and 'unmanifested' (to reside in invisible form in actual Kaal-form in the twenty-first brahmand) are his other forms and 'Kaal' is his main form. God Vishnu who presents in Kaal-form and manifested and unmanifested form, this is his childlike exploits.</p>
<p>It is said in Adhyay 2 Shlok 27, page no 5 - Oh Maitrey! At the time of destruction, on Pradhaan's i.e. Prakriti's being situated in a state of equilibrium i.e. on Purush's being situated separately from Prakriti, God Vishnu's Kaal form manifests.</p>
<p>Adhyay 2 Shlok 28 to 30, page no 5 - Immediately thereafter (at the time of creation) that ParBrahm Parmatma, the Universal form, Omnipresent, Lord of all living beings, the universal soul, Supreme God by His own desire entering into the vikaari&nbsp;Pradhaan and avikaari&nbsp;Purush agitated them|| 28, 29|| Just as smell, even when not active, only by its proximity agitates the mind; similarly, Parmeshwar by His proximity influences Pradhaan and Purush 30.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> - It has been clarified in Shlok no. 28 to 30 that apart from Prakriti (Durga) and Purush (Kaal God), there is some other Parmeshwar, who inspires both of these to again do creation.</p>
<p>It is written in Adhyay 2 on page no. 8 Shlok 66 - The same God Vishnu, being Srishta (the creator - Brahma), does his own creation. In Shlok no. 70, it is written - God Vishnu only is the one who does creation through Brahma etc states. He only is created and&nbsp;himself also dies. In Adhyay 4 Shlok no. 4 on page 11, it is written that there is some other Parmeshwar (Supreme God) who is also the Ishwar (God) of Brahma, Shiv etc Ishwars (Gods). Adhyay 4 Shlok 14-15, 17, 22 on page 11, 12, it is written - Earth said, "Oh one with Kaal appearance! Salutations to you. Oh God! You only, for the creation etc of the universe, adopt Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra form. Whichever form of yours appears in incarnation form, the gods worship that only. You only are Omkaar. It is written in Adhyay 4 Shlok 50 on page 14 - then that God Hari becoming equipped with Rajogun, acquiring four-faced Brahma form, created the nature.</p>
<p>It has been proved from the above-mentioned description that Rishi Parasar Ji based on hearsay knowledge i.e. Lokved, composed the Shri Vishnu Puran. Because Purna Parmatma, Himself appearing in the First Satyug, had imparted the actual knowledge to Shri Brahma Ji. Shri Brahma Ji told some knowledge and some selfmade imaginative knowledge to his descendents. Hearing from one another this lokved&nbsp;propagated to Shri Parasar Ji. Shri Parasar Ji has called Vishnu as Kaal as well as ParBrahm. This has also been proved from the above-mentioned description that Vishnu i.e. Kaal in Brahm form, by taking birth as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv, produces the nature. Brahm (Kaal) only by appearing in the three forms in Brahm lok, deceives by doing leela (divine act). He himself also dies there. (For special information, please read 'Information about Destruction' in book 'Gahri Nazar Gita Mein' in the description of Adhyay 8 Shlok 17). In that very Brahm lok, Brahm has created three places. One is Rajogun dominated; in that this very Kaal-form Brahm lives by acquiring his Brahma form, and keeping his wife Durga with him gives rise to Rajogun-dominated son; keeps his name Brahma and makes him do the production in one brahmand. Likewise, making a Satgun-dominated place in that very Brahm lok, lives himself by acquiring Vishnu form, and keeping his wife Durga (Prakriti) as his wife, gives rise to a son endowed with Satgun; keeps his name Vishnu. He makes that son do the task of maintaining the state in the three loks&nbsp;(Earth, Nether World, Heaven) in one&nbsp;brahmand (Evidence: Shiv Puran, published from Gita Press Gorakhpur, Translator: Hanuman Prasad Poddar, Chiman Lal Goswami, Rudra Sanhita Adhyay 6, 7 Page 102, 103).</p>
<p>In Brahmlok only, creating a third place dominant in Tamgun, himself lives in it by acquiring Shiv form and keeping his wife Durga (Prakriti) with him, through the act of husband and wife, in the same way gives rise to the third son who is endowed with Tamogun; keeps his name Shankar (Shiv). He makes this son kill the living beings of the three loks.</p>
<p>In Vishnu Puran, the knowledge upto Adhyay 4 is that of Kaal-form Brahm i.e. of Jyoti Niranjan. The mixed knowledge from Adhyay 5 onwards is of the divine acts (leelas) of the Kaal's son Satgun Vishnu and is the knowledge of his incarnations Shri Ram, Shri Krishna etc.</p>
<p>The thing to consider particularly is that the narrator of Shri Vishnu Puran is Shri Parasar Rishi. Purukuts heard this very knowledge from Daksh-etc Rishis, Sarasvat heard from Purukuts and Shri Parasar Rishi heard from Sarasvat. That knowledge was written in Shri Vishnu Puran, which is today in our hands. In this, even the knowledge of only one brahmand is incomplete. The knowledge of Shri Devi Puran, Shri Shiv Puran etc Purans has also been given by Brahma Ji. The knowledge imparted by Shri Parasar can not be similar to the knowledge delivered by Shri Brahma Ji. Therefore to understand Shri Vishnu Puran, help will be taken from Shri Devi Puran and Shri Shiv Puran. Because this knowledge has been given by Daksh-etc Rishis' father Shri Brahma Ji. To understand Shri Devi Puran and Shri Shiv Puran, assistance will be taken from Shrimad bhagwad Gita and the four Vedas. Because this knowledge has been imparted by God Kaal-form Brahm himself, who is the originator i.e. father of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv Ji. To understand the knowledge of Holy Vedas and Holy Shrimad Bhagwad Gita Ji, we will have to take help from Swasam Ved i.e. Sukshm Ved which has been given by Kaal-form Brahm's originator i.e. father Param Akshar Brahm (KavirDev); which SatPurush, on appearing, had Himself uttered through (KavirgirbhiH) Kavir Vaani / Kabir Speech. (Evidence is in Rigved Mandal 9 Sukt 96 Mantra 16 to 20).</p>
