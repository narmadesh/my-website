	<h2 class="title">Who Delivered the Knowledge of Shrimad Bhagavad Gita</h2>
	
<p>The knowledge of Holy Gita ji was delivered at that time when the battle of Mahabharat was about to happen. Arjun had refused to fight. Why was the battle taking place? This battle cannot even be given the title of a religious battle (crusade) because it was a matter of division of wealth between two families. The division of property of Kauravs and Pandavs was not happening. Kauravs had even refused to give half of the kingdom to the Pandavs. God Shri Krishna ji went three times as a peace-messenger to intervene between the two sides. But both the sides were unrelentingly adamant. Shri Krishna ji also warned them of the catastrophic aftermaths of the war that who knows how many sisters will become widows and how many children will be orphaned. You will not gain anything, but heinous sin. No one knows who will die and who will live in the battle? When the third time Shri Krishna ji went for negotiation, both the sides showed the list of all the kings along with their armies on their sides, and said that these many kings are in our favour and these in ours. When Shri Krishna ji saw that both the sides are rigid and ready for the war, then Shri Krishna ji thought that there is one more trick; let me use that too today. Shri Krishna ji thought that may be Pandavs, because of being my relatives, are being adamant thinking that Shri Krishna ji is with us; we will certainly be victorious (because Shri Krishna ji's sister Subhadra was married to Shri Arjun ji). Shri Krishna ji said that on one side, there will be my entire army and on the other side, I. Besides this, I also pledge that I will not take up any arms. On hearing this announcement, the ground slipped from under Pandavs' feet. They felt that now our defeat is certain. Considering this, the five Pandavs went out of the assembly saying that let us think about it. After some time, they requested Shri Krishna ji to come out of the assembly. When Shri Krishna ji&nbsp;came out, the Pandavs said, "Oh Lord! Get us five villages; we don't want war. Our self-esteem will also be maintained and as per your wish, the war will also be averted."</p>
<p>Shri Krishna ji was very pleased with this decision of Pandavs and thought that bad time has been obviated. Shri Krishna ji returned to the assembly. There were only Kauravs and their allies left in the assembly. Shri Krishna ji said, "Duryodhan, the war has been averted. It was also my heartfelt desire. You may give five villages to Pandavs. They are saying that they do not want a war." Duryodhan said, "For Pandavs, there is not even land equivalent to a needle's tip. If they want it, they may come to the field of Kurukshetra for a battle." Shri Krishna becoming annoyed on this, said, "Duryodhan, you are not a human being, but a devil. On one hand is half kingdom, and on the other, just five villages. Follow my advice, give five villages." Duryodhan became agitated with Shri Krishna and ordered other warriors present in the assembly to arrest Shri Krishna and imprison him. On getting the order, the warriors surrounded Shri Krishna ji from all sides. Shri Krishna ji showed his 'Viraat' (huge) form; as a result of which, all the warriors and Kauravs hid under the chairs in fear, and their eyes were shut by the strong light of Shri Krishna's body. Shri Krishna ji left from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let us ponder:</strong> - The evidence of the exhibition of the abovementioned 'Viraat' form is available in 'Sankshipt Mahabharat', published from Gita Press Gorakhpur. While delivering the knowledge of Gita ji in the field of Kurukshetra, in <strong>Adhyay 11 Shlok 32</strong>, the God narrating the Holy Gita has said, "Arjun, I am an enlarged Kaal. I have appeared now to eat all the loks." Just think that Shri Krishna ji was already with Shri Arjun ji. If Shri Krishna ji had been delivering the knowledge of Holy Gita ji, then he would not have said that I have appeared now. Shri Krishna ji was not Kaal. Pleased by just a sight of him, human beings and animals (cow etc) used to come to Shri Krishna ji and obtain love. Without his audience, gopis used to leave eating and drinking. Therefore Kaal is some other power. He, by entering into Shri Krishna ji's body like a ghost, narrated the gist of the four Holy Vedas in the form of the knowledge of Shrimad bhagwat Gita ji. Kaal (Brahm) has one thousand arms. Shri&nbsp;Krishna ji was an incarnation of Shri Vishnu ji, who has four arms. Then in Adhyay 11, Shlok 21 and 46, Arjun is saying, "Oh Lord! You are even eating the sages, gods and siddhs (endowed with supernatural powers), who are praising you only by reciting mantras from the Holy Vedas and are praying for the protection of their lives. Some are hanging in your jaws and some are going into your mouth. Oh Sahasrbaahu i.e. God with thousand arms! You please come in that same chaturbhuj (with four arms) form of yours. I am unable to stay composed after seeing your dreadful appearance."</p>
<p>In <strong>Adhyay 11 Shlok 47</strong>, Kaal, the God narrating Holy Gita ji, is saying, "Oh Arjun! This is my real 'Kaal' appearance, which nobody has seen before you."</p>
<p>One fact that has been proved from the aforesaid explanation is that in Kaurav's assembly, Shri Krishna ji had shown the 'Viraat' (huge) form and here in the battlefield, Kaal (by entering into Shri Krishna ji's body like a ghost) had shown his 'Viraat' form. Otherwise, he would not have said that nobody has seen this 'Viraat' form before, except you, because Shri Krishna ji had already shown his 'Viraat' form in Kaurav's assembly.</p>
<p>Secondly, this has been proved that the narrator of Holy Gita ji is Kaal (Brahm / Jyoti Niranjan), and not Shri Krishna ji because Shri Krishna never said before that I am Kaal and never said afterwards that I am Kaal. Shri Krishna ji can not be Kaal; men and women from far-off places used to long for a sight of his. Note: - What is 'Viraat' form?</p>
<p><strong>Viraat form:</strong> - If, during daytime or in a moonlit night, when your body's shadow is small, nearly the size of your body or slightly bigger, you gaze at the area of the chest of that shadow for two minutes, even if your eyes water, and then look at the sky ahead; you will see your own 'Viraat' form which will be white in colour and touching the sky. Likewise, every human being has his 'Viraat' form. But those, whose power of bhakti (worship) is more, their light becomes equally stronger.</p>
<p>Similarly, Shri Krishna ji was also equipped with supernatural powers because of the power of previous bhakti. He also displayed his 'Viraat' form by his supernatural power, which was less effulgent than the effulgent body (Viraat) of Kaal.</p>
<p>The third thing that has been proved is that God, who is the narrator of Holy Gita ji, is sahasrbaahu i.e. he possesses thousand arms, whereas Shri Krishna ji is an incarnation of Shri Vishnu ji who has four arms. Shri Vishnu ji possesses 16 kalaas (skills/art); whereas, Shri Jyoti Niranjan/ Kaal God, is equipped with thousand kalaas. For instance, one bulb is of 60 watt, one bulb of 100 watt, and another bulb is of 1000 watt. Every bulb has light, but there is a lot of difference. Similarly, the powers of both the gods and the brightness of their 'Viraat' forms were different.</p>
<p>Prior to acquiring this Tatvgyan (true spiritual knowledge), this Das (Rampal Das) used to question the Mahatma ji who used to explain the knowledge of Gita ji, that previously Shri Krishna ji had gone three times as a peace-messenger and had said that it is a heinous sin to fight, but when Shri Arjun ji himself while refusing to fight, said, "Oh Devkinandan, I do not want to fight. Foreseeing the destruction of the near and dear ones, relatives and of soldiers standing in front of me, I have firmly decided that even if I get the kingdom of the three loks (worlds), I will not fight. Rather I wish that Duryodhan and others may kill, the unarmed me, with arrows, so that my death can prevent the destruction resulting from the war. Oh Shri Krishna! I consider subsisting by eating begged food, better than fighting. Oh Krishna! By killing near and dear ones, we will only incur sin. My mind has stopped working. You are our Guru; I am your disciple. Suggest me whatever is in our favour. But I do not believe that any suggestion of yours will be able to persuade me to fight. In other words, I will not fight." (Evidence - Holy Gita ji, Adhyay 1 Shlok 31 to 39, 46, and Adhyay 2 Shlok 5 to 8.)</p>
<p>Then Kaal, entered in Shri Krishna ji's body, is repeatedly saying, "Arjun, don't be a coward; fight! Either you will die in war and go to heaven, or will win the war and rule the Earth." By saying all this, Kaal (Brahm) caused terrible destruction. To date, no saint - mahatma or a civilized person can be found with such a bad character.</p>
<p>Then those foolish guruji (quack) used to say that Arjun was relinquishing the moral duty of a Kshatriya (Member of a royal /warrior Hindu caste)&nbsp;. This would have caused damage to Kshatriyatv&nbsp;(status of a Kshatriya) and destruction of bravery forever. Shri Krishna ji had caused this battle of Mahabharat to make Arjun fulfil Kshatriya Dharm (religious and social obligation of a Kshatriya). Earlier, I used to remain silent after listening to this foolish story of theirs, because I was myself ignorant.</p>
<p>Please ponder again: - God Shri Krishna ji was himself a Kshatriya. After the assassination of Kans, Shri Agrasen ji had handed over the reins of Mathura to his grandson Shri Krishna ji. One day, Narad ji told Shri Krishna ji that a demon king 'Muchkand', who possesses supernatural powers, is sleeping in a nearby cave. He sleeps for six months and remains awake for next six months. While awake, he keeps fighting for six months and during the six months, when he is asleep, if anyone disturbs his sleep, then his eyes emit fire arrows and the person in front of him dies immediately. You beware! After saying this, Narad ji left.</p>
<p>After some time, on seeing Shri Krishna sitting on the throne of Mathura at such a small age, a king named Kalyavan, attacked Mathura with his army of eighteen crore soldiers. Shri Krishna ji saw that his enemy has a very large army and thought that God knows how many soldiers will loose their lives; why not get Kalyavan killed by Muchkand. On planning this, God Shri Krishna ji challenged Kalyavan for a fight and leaving the battle, ran away (forgetting Kshatriya Dharm and considering it essential to avert the destruction). He entered into the cave in which Muchkand was sleeping. Putting his pitambar (yellow cloth) over Muchkand's body, Shri Krishna ji went deeper into the cave and hid there. Following him, Kalyavan also entered the cave. Considering Muchkand to be Shri Krishna, Kalyavan held Muchkand's foot and twisted it, and said, "Coward, I won't leave you hiding here." Muchkand's sleep got disturbed because of pain, fire arrows came out of his eyes and Kalyavan got killed. Kalyavan's minister and soldiers took the body of their king and returned, because in a war, the death of the king&nbsp;was considered the defeat of the army. While leaving, they said, "We will appoint a new king and soon return, and Shri Krishna, we won't leave you."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shri Krishna ji called his Chief Engineer, Shri Vishwakarma ji, and said, "Find a place, which is surrounded by sea on its three sides, and has only one way (gate). Construct a Dwarika (having one gate) city there as soon as possible. We will soon depart from here. These foolish people will not let us live here in peace." Shri Krishna ji was such a noble soul and anti-war that he averted battle on the cost of his Kshatriyatv. Can the same Shri Krishna ji then give an evil advice to fight to his dear friend and relative? Never. Jyoti Niranjan by entering like a ghost into Shri Krishna ji's body had got all these evil deeds done. Other examples -</p>
<p>Shri Vishnu ji himself had incarnated in the form of Shri Krishna ji. Once, Shri Bhrigu Rishi (sage) kicked in the chest of God Vishnu ji (Shri Krishna ji) who was sitting comfortably. Shri Vishnu ji caressed Shri Bhrigu Rishi ji's foot and said, "Oh Rishiwar! I hope your soft foot did not get hurt because my chest is like a hard rock." Had Shri Vishnu ji (Shri Krishna ji) been a war-lover, he would have cut Shri Bhrigu Rishi ji into infinite pieces with his sudarshan chakra(Name of a circular weapon)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The reality is that God Kaal, who is the master of twentyone brahmands, has pledged that he will not appear before any one in his manifested bodily form (in his actual human-like visible form). He only by assuming an immaterial body entering into Shri Krishna ji's body like a ghost gave the knowledge of Gita (the essence of Vedas) correctly, but left no shortcomings in making conjectures to cause the war. Who is Kaal (Brahm)? To know about this, read "Creation of Nature" in the book "Gyan Ganga".</p>
<p>Until the battle of Mahabharat ended, Jyoti Niranjan (Kaal / Brahm / Kshar Purush) remained in the body of Shri Krishna ji, and made Yudhishthir lie, that say that Ashwatthama has died; he got Bheem's grandson and Ghatotkachh's son Shri Barbreek alias Babru Bhan's head cut off and himself lifted the wheel of the chariot as a&nbsp;weapon. All this turmoil was caused by Kaal only, and not by God Shri Krishna ji. As soon as the battle of Mahabharat ended, Kaal came out of Shri Krishna ji's body.</p>
<p>Shri Krishna ji accepted this request and fixed a date, time and place. On the fixed date, Shri Arjun said to God Shri Krishna ji, "Lord! Deliver that very knowledge of Gita ji, in its entirety, today, as I have forgotten it because of mental aberration." Then Shri Krishna ji said, "Oh Arjun! You definitely are very devotionless. Your memory is not good. Why did you forget such a sacred knowledge?" Then he himself said that now I cannot say that entire knowledge of Gita i.e. I don't know it. He said, "At that time I had said it by being connected with God (yog-yukt)."</p>
<p>It is a matter of consideration that if God Shri Krishna ji had got connected with God during the war, then it would not have been difficult to connect with God during peacetime. Whereas, years later, Shri Vyas ji wrote that very knowledge of Holy Gita ji in its entirety. At that time, that Brahm (Kaal / Jyoti Niranjan) entered into Shri Vyas Ji's body and got the Holy Shrimad bhagwat Gita Ji written down, which is now in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>For reference: Sankshipt (concise) Mahabharat, page no. 667 and page no 1531 of the old book: -</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#008080;"><em>Na shakyaM tanmya bhooyasttha vaktumsheshatH ||&nbsp;<br>
ParM hi Brahm kathitM yogyukten tanmya |</em></span></p>
<p>(Mahabharat, Aashrv0 1612-13)</p>
<p><strong>God said</strong> - 'Repeating all that again in that very form is not possible for me now. At that time, I had explained the ParmatavTatv (reality about God) by being connected with God (yog-yukt).'</p>
<p>Extract from Sankshipt Mahabharat, Part Two, Page no. 1531:</p>
<p>('Shri Krishna's enquiring about Gita from Arjun; Sidh Maharishi Vaishampayan and Kashyap's dialogue') - Pandunandan Arjun was very happy in the company of Shri Krishna. He once glanced at that captivating assembly and said these words to God - 'Devkinandan! At the time of war, I became conscious of your magnificence and witnessed the sight of your Godly form; however, Keshav! The knowledge, which you had affectionately imparted to me earlier, I have forgotten all that now because of mental aberration. An eager desire continually arises in my heart to hear those subjects. Here, you are soon going to leave for Dwarika. Hence, please narrate all those subjects again to me.</p>
<p>Vaishampayan Ji says - On Arjun's saying this, the greatest of the orators, highly glorious God Shri Krishna embraced him and answered this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shri Krishna said - Arjun! At that time, I had made you hear the most secretive subject and had introduced my swaroopbhoot dharm sanatan PurushottamTatv (the immemorial religion and the reality of myself and the Supreme God form) and (exhibiting dark-bright state) had also described the eternal loks/worlds. But the fact that you have not remembered that updesh (spiritual instruction) because of your foolishness, I feel very sorry to learn this. It does not seem possible to recall all those things fully now. Pandunandan! You are certainly very devotionless. Your memory does not seem to be efficient. Now, it is difficult for me to repeat that updesh in its entirety, because at that time, I had explained the ParmatamTatv (the reality about God) by being connected with God (yogyukt). (For more information, read - 'Sankshipt Mahabharat, Part Two')&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please think: - It has been proved from the above-mentioned excerpts of Mahabharat, excerpts of Shri Vishnu Puran and excerpts of Shrimadbhgwad Gita ji that Shri Krishna ji did not narrate the knowledge of Shrimad bhagwat Gita; it was narrated by Kaal-form Brahm (Jyoti Niranjan) i.e. MahaVishnu had delivered it by entering like a ghost into the body of Shri Krishna ji.</p>
<p>Other evidence: - 1. Shri Vishnu Puran (published from Gita Press Gorakhpur) Part- 4, Second Adhyay, Shlok 26 on page 233 - Vishnu ji (MahaVishnu i.e. Kaal-form Brahm), at the time of the fight between the demi-gods and the demons, accepting the request of the demi-gods said, "I, by entering into the body of royal sage&nbsp;Shashaad's son Puranjay for some time, will destroy the demons."</p>
<p>2. Shri Vishnu Puran (published from Gita Press Gorakhpur) Part- 4, Third Adhyay, Shlok 6 on page 242, Shri Vishnu ji, while taking the side of Naags in the fight between Gandharvs and Naags, said, "I (MahaVishnu i.e. Kaal-form Brahm) by entering into the body of Mandhata's son Purukuts, will destroy all of those evil Gandharvs."</p>
<p>Other evidence: - After some time, Shri Yudhishthir Ji started having nightmares. When he asked the reason and solution from Shri Krishna Ji, he was told, "The sins you have committed during the war, the crime of that homicide is causing you distress. Perform a yagya1 for this." On hearing this from Shri Krishna Ji, Shri Arjun became very upset and thought in his mind that God Shri Krishna Ji while narrating Holy Gita was saying that Arjun, you will not incur any sin; you may fight (Holy Gita, Adhyay 2 Shlok 37-38). Even if you die in war, you will enjoy the pleasures of heaven; otherwise, on winning the war, you will enjoy the kingdom of Earth. Arjun thought that the solution, which Shri Krishna Ji has told for the removal of misery, will involve an expenditure of crores of rupees. As a result of which, elder brother's suffering will be dispelled. If I will argue with Shri Krishna Ji that while giving the knowledge of Gita Ji, you were saying that you will not incur sin, now you are saying contrary to this, then my elder brother might think that seeing the expenditure of crores of rupees, Arjun has become agitated and is not happy with the removal of my suffering. Therefore, considering it appropriate to remain silent, he happily gave consent that we will do as you say. Shri Krishna Ji fixed the date for that yagya. That yagya also became successful only when Shri Sudarshan Swapach had food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some time, the whole Yadav community perished as a result of Rishi Durvasa Ji's curse and a hunter (who was the soul of Sugreev's brother, Baali, in Tretayug) shot a poisoned arrow in the sole of Shri Krishna's foot. On the arrival of the five Pandavs on the incident site, Shri Krishna Ji said, "You are my disciples and I am also your religious Guru. Therefore, listen to my last order. One is that Arjun, you may take all the women of Dwarika to Indraprasth&nbsp;(Delhi) because there is no man left here; and second, you all Pandavs may abandon your kingdom and by meditating in Himalayas may mortify your bodies there. Because you have the terrifying sins of the murders you committed during the war of Mahabharat on your head." At that time, Arjun could not stop himself and said, "Lord! Although you are in such a state that I should not say such things, but Lord, if today, my doubt is not cleared then I will not even be able to die in peace. I will keep crying for the rest of my life." Shri Krishna Ji said, "Ask whatever you want to ask, these are my final moments." Shri Arjun, with tears in his eyes, said, "Lord, please don't mind. When you had given the knowledge of Holy Gita Ji, at that time, I was refusing to fight. You had said that Arjun, you have the best of both worlds; if you die in war, you will go to heaven and if you are victorios, you will rule the Earth and you will not incur any sin. We fought the battle under your very guidance and according to your orders. (Evidence: Holy Gita Adhyay 2 Shlok 37-38). Oh Lord! We do not have the best of either world. Neither did we die in the war and attain heaven, and now, you are ordering us to abandon the kingdom, so, nor are we able to enjoy the kingdom of Earth. What interest did you have in doing this deceitful act?" On hearing these words from Arjun's mouth, Yudhishthir Ji said, "Arjun, at this moment when God is counting his last breaths, your ill-natured behaviour is not justified."</p>
<p>Shri Krishna Ji said,&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arjun, today I am in my final state. You are very dear to me; today I will tell the truth that there is another villainous power which kept us operating like a machine; I don't know what I said in Gita. But whatever I am saying now is in your benefit." Saying these words with tears in his eyes, Shri Krishna Ji passed away. It has been proved from the above-mentioned decription that Shri Krishna Ji did not speak the knowledge of Gita Ji. It has been spoken by Brahm (Jyoti Niranjan / Kaal), who is the master of twenty-one brahmands. Who is Kaal (Brahm)? To know this, please read 'Creation of Nature' in this very book "Gyan Ganga,".</p>
<p>After performing the last rites of Shri Krishna along with all the Yadavs, the four Pandav brothers, left Arjun and returned to&nbsp;Indraprastha (Delhi). Subsequently, Arjun was bringing Dwarika's women along with him. On the way, wild people looted all the gopis (women of Dwarika) and abducted a few and beat Arjun. Arjun had the same 'Gandeev' bow in his hand, with which he had committed infinite killings in the Mahabharat war. Even that did not work. Then Arjun said, "This Shri Krishna was actually a liar and a deceitful person. When he had to make me commit sin in the war, he granted me power. I used to knock down hundreds of warriors with one arrow, and today he has snatched that power away; I am standing here helplessly while being beaten." In this very matter, Purna Brahm God Kabir (KavirDev) says that Shri Krishna Ji was not a fraud or a liar. Kaal (Jyoti Niranjan) is commiting all these wrongdoings. Until this soul comes in the refuge of God Kabir (SatPurush) by means of a Complete Saint (Tatvdarshi), Kaal will keep on inflicting atrocities like this. One gains full information through Tatvgyan (True spiritual knowledge). Therefore, who is Kaal? To know this, please read 'Creation of Nature' in this very book "Gyan Ganga".</p>
<p><strong>Special Consideration:</strong> It has been proved from the abovementioned evidence that the knowledge of Shrimad bhagwat Gita was not narrated by Shri Krishna, rather it was spoken by Brahm (Kaal i.e. Jyoti Niranjan) by entering like a ghost into Shri Krishna Ji's body.&nbsp;</p>
